# PhoneBook-Application
This is a phone book that stores all your contacts and that allows you to perform all the operations that you can need to use a PhoneBook Application like add contact, delete, modify and search contact etc. It is very interactive and easy to use.
I made this project as an assignment of my data structure and algorithm course.
The main class of the phone book is implemented using the double linked list.
It stores the contacts in sorted order as we store in a mobile phone's contact list.

NEXT CHANGE: The next change I will make in this application is to link a database to it so that all the contacts stored in it does not get lost once the application is closed.
