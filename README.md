# Phonebook Application in C++

Welcome to the Phonebook Application repository! This project showcases a comprehensive, feature-rich phonebook application developed in C++ with a strong emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and efficient data management using a doubly linked list.

**Key Features**:

**1. Object-Oriented Approach**: The application leverages the power of OOP to design and structure code for scalability, maintainability, and ease of extension.

**2. Doubly Linked List**: We've employed a doubly linked list data structure to manage and organize contact information efficiently, providing fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval capabilities.

**3. User-Friendly Interface**: The phonebook features an intuitive and user-friendly interface for adding, searching, updating, and deleting contacts.

**4. Contact Management**: Seamlessly manage an extensive list of contacts, including names, phone numbers, email addresses, and additional notes.

**5. Search and Filter**: Use powerful search and filtering options to quickly locate specific contacts by name, phone number, or other attributes.

**Usage**:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler.2. 
3. Run the executable to access the phonebook application.

**Contributions**: We welcome contributions from the open-source community to enhance and expand the functionality of the phonebook application. Feel free to fork, make improvements, and submit pull requests.
